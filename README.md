# DataStructure
I create this project to learn data structrue.
On 2022/6/29 I finished all tests about memory leaks. Now I finished the structrues of SqList plus LinkList, and its practise: Ploynmial(include add, sub and multiply).
I use the CRT Debugging Techniques to detect the memory leak. And I utlise the precompile codes to materialise the "normal form" temporarily. With proceeding to learn data structrue and C++, I will materialise the real normal form of C plus plus.
